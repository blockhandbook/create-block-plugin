/*!
 * Tailwind Styles
 *
 * Tailwind styles get applied and enqueued on both the front of your
 * site and in the editor.
 *
 * We use the tailwindcss important selector strategy
 * ( https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#selector-strategy )
 * which will prefix all of your utilities with a selector that
 * includes your plugin slug.
 *
 * i.e. - If your plugin slug is 'test-test' then all Tailwind styles
 * will be prefixed with the class [class*="wp-block-test-test"] so the utility
 * .p-10 would look like this [class*="wp-block-test-test"] .p-10
 *
 * You can edit the prefixed selector in the root tailwind.config.js file
